# randomwordbot
This is a discord bot that returns a random English word
## Requirements
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing)
* [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install)
## Setup
To set the bot up, you need to create a bot on the Discord [developers page](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Copy the bot token from the bot page of your application, and replace the `TOKEN` at the end of the discordbot.py file.

To install the requirements, install Python 3 first, and then use pip to install discord.py and requests. `python -m pip install -U discord.py requests` should do.

To clone the repository, you need to do `git clone https://github.com/flugschwein/randomwordbot` to also get the long English word list you have to do `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.

Run the bot by using `python discordbot.py`.
